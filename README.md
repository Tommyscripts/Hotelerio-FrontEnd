<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Prerequisites

To be able to install and run this project, you should run the following commands in order:
   ```sh
  npm i 
  ```
   ```sh
  npm run build / npm run dev
  ```
  
## Usage
This front-end webpage is the continuation of our [back-end project](https://github.com/TebyTeb/Hotelerio-backendAPI), and was built to work with it. Together they form a Demo application for automating reservations in a hotel with registered clients. 

We use VueJS framework along with several packages, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Sass and Bootstrap, to create a consistent application. 

Any user will be able to:
* Register in the webpage
* Make a reservation in the Hotel
* Check his/her own profile
* Check his/her active reservations
